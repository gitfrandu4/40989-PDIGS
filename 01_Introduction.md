## D3. Product Backlog

### User Stories

User stories are simple descriptions of features from the user's perspective, emphasizing value to the user. A complete user story has three components, known as the **CCC** (Card, Conversation, Confirmation):

- **Card**: Written description.
- **Conversation**: Discussions for clarity and detail.
- **Confirmation**: Tests ensuring completion criteria are met.

#### Example User Story Structure:

> “As a (user role), I want to (action), so that (benefit).”

- **Example**: “As an online shopper, I want to pay with my credit card, so that I can complete my purchase quickly.”

### Roles and Responsibilities

**Developers:**
- Assist customers in formulating clear, valuable stories.
- Clarify how user needs translate into valuable functionality.

**Customers:**
- Write user stories that initiate conversations rather than specifying overly detailed instructions upfront.
- Ensure stories add clear user value, are independent, testable, and well-sized.

**Customer Team:**
- Includes testers, product managers, interaction designers, and real users.
- Writes and prioritizes stories and defines acceptance criteria.

---

### Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests verify whether the developed feature meets the initial story requirements.

**Example (Online Shopping App):**
- Payment tested successfully with Visa, MasterCard, American Express.
- Payment failed with Diner’s Club card (which the system does not support).
- Various scenarios: expired cards, debit cards, incorrect or missing security numbers, over-limit transactions.

**Good Practice**: Clearly define acceptance criteria before development to ensure clarity and efficiency.

---

### User Story Lifecycle

A typical user story evolves through stages:

1. **Discovery** (initial understanding of user needs)
2. **Product Backlog** (prioritized user stories)
3. **Release Planning** (stories selected for specific release)
4. **Sprint Planning** (stories broken into detailed tasks)
5. **Sprint Execution** (development and testing)
6. **Acceptance Testing & Delivery**

**Example**:

> Initial Story: “As a shopper, I want a simple checkout, so I can easily complete my purchases.”  
> Sprint Backlog Tasks:
> - Implement credit card payment gateway.
> - Integrate cart with payment page.
> - Create user-friendly payment confirmation.

---

### Advantages and Disadvantages of User Stories

**Advantages:**
- Encourages direct communication and rapid feedback.
- Understandable by technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Suited for iterative (agile) development.
- Encourages user participation and detail flexibility.

**Disadvantages:**
- Challenging to scale for large projects.
- Additional documentation might be needed for traceability in extensive projects.

---

### Writing Effective User Stories (INVEST Criteria)

Created by Bill Wake, the INVEST criteria help ensure high-quality user stories:

| Criterion    | Explanation                                               | Example                                                        |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Independent  | Minimal dependency on other stories.                      | Separate payment by Visa, MasterCard, AMEX into individual stories. |
| Negotiable   | Details finalized through customer-developer conversations. | Acceptance criteria detailed on story cards.                       |
| Valuable     | Delivers clear value to end-user or customer.             | Storing payment info speeds future checkouts.                    |
| Estimatable  | Team can estimate effort accurately.                      | Conduct technical/functional spikes for unclear areas.           |
| Small        | Sized appropriately; too large (epics) should be split.   | “User can manage resume” → “User can create/edit/delete resume.” |
| Testable     | Can clearly define pass/fail criteria.                    | “User can export order history as CSV.”                          |

---

### Clarifying Examples (INVEST Criteria Applied)

- **Independent**:  
  Instead of "User can pay by credit card," create independent stories like:  
  - "User pays by Visa"  
  - "User pays by MasterCard"

- **Negotiable**:  
  Initially vague "User manages account details" refined after discussions:  
  - "User updates shipping address"  
  - "User changes saved payment method"

- **Valuable**:  
  Avoid vague technical requirements. Instead:  
  - "User can view error messages easily (user value)"  
  Rather than "System uses common logging classes (technical detail)."

- **Estimatable** (Handling Uncertainty):  
  Use spikes (research-oriented tasks):  
  - **Functional Spike**: Prototype UI to gather user feedback.  
  - **Technical Spike**: Research third-party APIs for integration feasibility.

**Spike Examples**:  
- "Prototype energy usage histogram to validate visual clarity." (Functional Spike)  
- "Test API response times to assess real-time dashboard feasibility." (Technical Spike)

- **Small** (Splitting Epics):  
  Large stories ("epics") divided into smaller stories:  
  Original epic: "User can manage job search profiles."  
  Smaller stories:  
  - "User creates new job search profiles."  
  - "User edits existing profiles."  
  - "User deletes profiles."

- **Testable**:  
  Clearly defined acceptance criteria:  
  - Good: "User can export order history as CSV."  
  - Poor: "System feels fast and responsive."

### Real-world Example: Bookshop Application

**Example User Stories:**

- **Search**:
  - "User searches books by title, author, ISBN."
  - "User views detailed book info (pages, description)."

- **Purchase**:
  - "User adds/removes books from cart."
  - "User completes checkout with credit card."

- **User Accounts**:
  - "User creates account with saved payment and shipping details."
  - "User edits account info."

- **Additional Features**:
  - "User creates visible wish lists."
  - "User writes and submits book reviews."

**Constraints (special considerations)**:  
- "System supports peak use of up to 50 concurrent users."  
- "Order records integrate seamlessly with telephone orders."

---

### Study Notes & Good Practices

- Keep user stories concise; use conversations to elaborate.
- Always prioritize stories by user value.
- Regularly review acceptance criteria clarity and completeness.
- Use spikes for uncertainty; they're an essential agile practice.
- Document essential details clearly to avoid misunderstandings.
