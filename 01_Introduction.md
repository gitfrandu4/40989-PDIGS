## D2. Areas, tasks and modalities in project management

### Introduction to Project Management

Project Management (PM) involves planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals.

### Knowledge Areas of Project Management

Top 10 PM Knowledge Areas:

1. **Integration Management**: Coordinate project activities across all areas.
2. **Scope Management**: Ensure all necessary project elements are included.
3. **Time Management**: Timely completion of project activities.
4. **Quality Management**: Ensure outputs meet user needs and standards.
5. **Resource Management**: Efficiently manage and monitor project resources.
6. **Communications Management**: Effective planning and implementation of communications.
7. **Procurement Management**: Manage purchasing and contracts.
8. **Stakeholder Management**: Actively engage stakeholders.
9. **Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate potential risks.
10. **Cost Management**: Control financial resources effectively.

### Predictive vs Adaptive Management

#### Predictive Management

- The **scope** of work **and requirements** for the project **are clear** and justify the detailed upfront planning.
- Also called traditional, conventional or waterfall project management.
- Popular methodologies:
  - PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)
  - PRINCE2 (Projects in Controlled Environments)
  - Waterfall

#### Adaptive Management

The **scope** of work and requirements for the project are difficult to define.

- Rapidly changing environment.
- Requirements are clarified in short iterations.
- Also referred to as responsive, iterative or agile project management.
- Frameworks include:
  - Scrum
  - Kanban
  - XP (Extreme programming)
  - DSDM (Dynamic system development method)
  - Crystal
  - FDD (Feature-driven development)

#### Hybrid Approach

- There is no "better" approach, only what fits the project you`re working on.
- Every project is unique and requires a tailored approach. You will find differences in scale, scope and requirements.
- Considering the project first and _then_ selection the right methodology is key.

Choosing a **hybrid approach** allows you to combine the best of both worlds, leveraging the strengths of predictive and adaptive methodologies.

- Predictive and adaptive approaches can work well together.
- You may choose a hybrid of methodologies to get the best result for your project (for example PRINCE2 combine with Agile).
- The PMI's PMBOK Guide framework includes a consideration for Agile, giving you room to incorporate elements of adaptive into your predictive project work.

### Development vs Management

**Interactions between Development and Management:**

<img src="assets/2025-03-23-23-37-04.png" alt="Development vs Management" width="400"/>

### Project Management Overview

#### Essential elements for a successful project

- Delivers as promised.
- Completes on time.
- Completes within budget.
- Delivers quality.
- Achieves original purpose.
- Meets all stakeholder expectations.
- Maintains “win-win” relationships.

#### What is a project?

A project is the work performed by an organization **one time** to produce a **unique** outcome.

- By _one time_, we mean the work has a definite beginning and a definite end.
- By _unique_, we mean the work result is different in one or more ways from anything the organization has produced before.

Examples of projects include the following:

- Building a new house
- Developing a new software application
- Performing an assessment of current manufacturing processes
- Improving an organizational business process
- Writing a book
- Relocating a company’s technology infrastructure to a new location or to a cloud platform
- Merging two organizations
- Developing a new medical device

**What is not a project?**

Operational work (operations of an organization) is the ongoing, repetitive set of activities that sustain the organization.

Examples of ongoing operations include the following:

- Processing customer orders
- Performing accounts receivable and accounts payable activities
- Executing daily manufacturing orders
- Performing recommended equipment maintenance procedures
- Conducting customer account maintenance

### Trends in Project Management

<img src="assets/2025-03-23-23-41-07.png" alt="Trends in Project Management" width="400"/>

- **Agile approaches**

  - Pace of change
  - Need to adapt and generate products/systems quickly
  - Difficulty in developing detailed work plans upfront

- **DevOps and DevSecOps**

  - Deliver value faster
  - Integration and collaboration among traditionally disparate groups

  - Organizations are having to respond and update legacy

- **Mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) applications**

  - Growing use of mobile and wearable technologies
  - Accelerating use of smart sensors in almost all devices

- **Social media**

  - When used responsibly and with purpose both internal and external to the organization, social media is a powerful tool
  - If guidelines and security protocols are not established, it can be a problem.

- **Project management collaboration tools**

  - The move to virtual teams was accelerated in response to the pandemic
  - The ability to set up and use a cloud-based collaboration work environment effectively is important

- **Work management tools**

  - Many organizations are leveraging work management tools to capture, manage, and monitor all work elements of a project and product

- **GDPR/HIPAA privacy compliance**

  - **GDPR** (_General Data Protection Regulation_) / **HIPAA** (_Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act_) compliance requires to set up procedures and systems to ensure specific data items are protected and not put at risk.

- **Managing virtual, cross-functional, and multicultural teams**

  - Continuous advancements in workgroup and communications tools
  - Increased integration of processes within an organization
  - Continuous drive for increased organizational efficiencies
  - It is very likely that your project team will consist of members from different physical locations (virtual), different functional departments (cross-functional), or different cultures (multicultural, global).

- **Change agent**

  - Most projects represent a change to business as usual
  - The project manager is expected to play a key role in leading the stakeholders through the change and acceptance process.

- **Servant leadership**

  - Lack of formal authority
  - Need to understand the requirements of all stakeholders
  - Importance of facilitation, collaboration, and managing expectations
  - There is a growing awareness that a servant leadership style is paramount for effective project management

- **Managing vendors**

  - Increased outsourcing of non-core activities
  - Increased use of cloud services
  - Projects leverage one or more vendors (suppliers) to get work done

- **Working with PMOs and corporate governance processes**

  - In corporate or multiple business unit environment, you most likely deal with a Project Management Office (PMO), a Product Line Management group, or other corporate governance processes

### Roles and Skills of a Project Manager

**Roles:**

- Planner & Organizer
- Risk Manager
- Coach & Facilitator
- Communicator
- Negotiator
- Resource Manager

**Key Skills:**

- Hard Skills: Financial budgeting, PM methodologies, resource optimization, accurate documentation.

### Common Project Management Mistakes

- Misaligned organizational objectives
- Poor stakeholder communication
- Unrealistic scheduling
- Resource mismanagement
- Neglecting change control
- Inadequate risk planning

### Commitment vs Involvement

Illustrated by the chicken and pig analogy: "The chicken is involved, but the pig is committed."

## D3. Product Backlog

### User Stories

User stories are simple descriptions of features from the user's perspective, emphasizing value to the user. A complete user story has three components, known as the **CCC** (Card, Conversation, Confirmation):

- **Card**: Written description.
- **Conversation**: Discussions for clarity and detail.
- **Confirmation**: Tests ensuring completion criteria are met.

#### Example User Story Structure:

> “As a (user role), I want to (action), so that (benefit).”

- **Example**: “As an online shopper, I want to pay with my credit card, so that I can complete my purchase quickly.”

### Roles and Responsibilities

**Developers:**

- Assist customers in formulating clear, valuable stories.
- Clarify how user needs translate into valuable functionality.

**Customers:**

- Write user stories that initiate conversations rather than specifying overly detailed instructions upfront.
- Ensure stories add clear user value, are independent, testable, and well-sized.

**Customer Team:**

- Includes testers, product managers, interaction designers, and real users.
- Writes and prioritizes stories and defines acceptance criteria.

---

### Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests verify whether the developed feature meets the initial story requirements.

**Example (Online Shopping App):**

- Payment tested successfully with Visa, MasterCard, American Express.
- Payment failed with Diner’s Club card (which the system does not support).
- Various scenarios: expired cards, debit cards, incorrect or missing security numbers, over-limit transactions.

**Good Practice**: Clearly define acceptance criteria before development to ensure clarity and efficiency.

---

### User Story Lifecycle

A typical user story evolves through stages:

1. **Discovery** (initial understanding of user needs)
2. **Product Backlog** (prioritized user stories)
3. **Release Planning** (stories selected for specific release)
4. **Sprint Planning** (stories broken into detailed tasks)
5. **Sprint Execution** (development and testing)
6. **Acceptance Testing & Delivery**

**Example**:

> Initial Story: “As a shopper, I want a simple checkout, so I can easily complete my purchases.”  
> Sprint Backlog Tasks:
>
> - Implement credit card payment gateway.
> - Integrate cart with payment page.
> - Create user-friendly payment confirmation.

---

### Advantages and Disadvantages of User Stories

**Advantages:**

- Encourages direct communication and rapid feedback.
- Understandable by technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Suited for iterative (agile) development.
- Encourages user participation and detail flexibility.

**Disadvantages:**

- Challenging to scale for large projects.
- Additional documentation might be needed for traceability in extensive projects.

---

### Writing Effective User Stories (INVEST Criteria)

Created by Bill Wake, the INVEST criteria help ensure high-quality user stories:

| Criterion   | Explanation                                                 | Example                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Independent | Minimal dependency on other stories.                        | Separate payment by Visa, MasterCard, AMEX into individual stories. |
| Negotiable  | Details finalized through customer-developer conversations. | Acceptance criteria detailed on story cards.                        |
| Valuable    | Delivers clear value to end-user or customer.               | Storing payment info speeds future checkouts.                       |
| Estimatable | Team can estimate effort accurately.                        | Conduct technical/functional spikes for unclear areas.              |
| Small       | Sized appropriately; too large (epics) should be split.     | “User can manage resume” → “User can create/edit/delete resume.”    |
| Testable    | Can clearly define pass/fail criteria.                      | “User can export order history as CSV.”                             |

---

### Clarifying Examples (INVEST Criteria Applied)

- **Independent**:  
  Instead of "User can pay by credit card," create independent stories like:

  - "User pays by Visa"
  - "User pays by MasterCard"

- **Negotiable**:  
  Initially vague "User manages account details" refined after discussions:

  - "User updates shipping address"
  - "User changes saved payment method"

- **Valuable**:  
  Avoid vague technical requirements. Instead:

  - "User can view error messages easily (user value)"  
    Rather than "System uses common logging classes (technical detail)."

- **Estimatable** (Handling Uncertainty):  
  Use spikes (research-oriented tasks):
  - **Functional Spike**: Prototype UI to gather user feedback.
  - **Technical Spike**: Research third-party APIs for integration feasibility.

**Spike Examples**:

- "Prototype energy usage histogram to validate visual clarity." (Functional Spike)
- "Test API response times to assess real-time dashboard feasibility." (Technical Spike)

- **Small** (Splitting Epics):  
  Large stories ("epics") divided into smaller stories:  
  Original epic: "User can manage job search profiles."  
  Smaller stories:

  - "User creates new job search profiles."
  - "User edits existing profiles."
  - "User deletes profiles."

- **Testable**:  
  Clearly defined acceptance criteria:
  - Good: "User can export order history as CSV."
  - Poor: "System feels fast and responsive."

---

### Real-world Example: Bookshop Application

**Example User Stories:**

- **Search**:

  - "User searches books by title, author, ISBN."
  - "User views detailed book info (pages, description)."

- **Purchase**:

  - "User adds/removes books from cart."
  - "User completes checkout with credit card."

- **User Accounts**:

  - "User creates account with saved payment and shipping details."
  - "User edits account info."

- **Additional Features**:
  - "User creates visible wish lists."
  - "User writes and submits book reviews."

**Constraints (special considerations)**:

- "System supports peak use of up to 50 concurrent users."
- "Order records integrate seamlessly with telephone orders."

---

### Study Notes & Good Practices

- Keep user stories concise; use conversations to elaborate.
- Always prioritize stories by user value.
- Regularly review acceptance criteria clarity and completeness.
- Use spikes for uncertainty; they're an essential agile practice.
- Document essential details clearly to avoid misunderstandings.
