#### Beyond SWOT: Advanced Analysis Techniques

While SWOT provides a valuable foundation, consider these advanced techniques for deeper analysis:

1. **TOWS Matrix**: Takes SWOT a step further by explicitly mapping strategies that:

   - Use strengths to take advantage of opportunities (S-O strategies)
   - Use strengths to avoid threats (S-T strategies)
   - Overcome weaknesses by taking advantage of opportunities (W-O strategies)
   - Minimize weaknesses and avoid threats (W-T strategies)

2. **PEST Analysis**: Examines Political, Economic, Social, and Technological factors that might influence your project.

3. **Porter's Five Forces**: Analyzes competitive intensity and market attractiveness.

By conducting a thorough SWOT analysis and using it to inform strategic planning, project managers can significantly improve their project's chances of success in a competitive environment.

## D2. Areas, tasks and modalities in project management

### Introduction to Project Management

Project Management (PM) involves planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals.

### Knowledge Areas of Project Management

Project Management is organized into ten major knowledge areas, each representing a set of concepts, terms, and activities that make up a professional field or area of specialization. Understanding these areas is crucial for effective project management:

1. **Integration Management**: Coordinates and unifies all project elements and processes.

   - _What it involves_: Project charter development, project management plan, directing and managing project work, monitoring and controlling project work, managing change control, closing project phases or the project.
   - _Example_: A software development project manager creates a unified project plan that integrates the requirements, schedule, budget, quality measures, and resource allocation into a coherent whole, ensuring all project components work together seamlessly.

2. **Scope Management**: Ensures the project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully.

   - _What it involves_: Requirements collection, scope definition, creating work breakdown structure (WBS), scope validation, and scope control.
   - _Example_: For a mobile app development project, the project manager creates a detailed WBS that breaks down all necessary features and components, while actively preventing scope creep when stakeholders request additional features not in the original plan.

3. **Time Management**: Focuses on the processes required to ensure timely completion of the project.

   - _What it involves_: Activity definition, sequencing, resource estimation, duration estimation, schedule development and control.
   - _Example_: Using critical path analysis, a construction project manager identifies that foundation work and electrical installations are critical activities that must be completed on schedule to avoid delaying the entire project.

4. **Quality Management**: Ensures the project will satisfy the stated or implied needs for which it was undertaken.

   - _What it involves_: Quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.
   - _Example_: A medical device development project implements rigorous testing protocols at various stages of development to ensure the final product meets FDA approval standards and patient safety requirements.

5. **Resource Management**: Involves organizing, managing, and leading the project team and physical resources.

   - _What it involves_: Human resource planning, acquiring team members, developing the team, and managing the team.
   - _Example_: An IT infrastructure project manager assigns specialized roles based on expertise, schedules regular skill development sessions, and balances workload to prevent burnout while ensuring hardware resources are available when needed.

6. **Communications Management**: Ensures proper generation, collection, distribution, storage, retrieval, and disposition of project information.

   - _What it involves_: Communications planning, information distribution, performance reporting, and stakeholder management.
   - _Example_: For a global software implementation project, the manager establishes a communication plan with regular status meetings, an online project portal for documentation, and tailored reporting for different stakeholder groups across multiple time zones.

7. **Procurement Management**: Covers the processes needed to purchase or acquire products, services, or results from outside the project team.

   - _What it involves_: Procurement planning, solicitation planning, solicitation, source selection, contract administration, and contract closure.
   - _Example_: A large event management project requires contracting specialized audio-visual services, catering, and venue rental, all of which the project manager handles through formal RFP processes and vendor selection criteria.

8. **Stakeholder Management**: Identifies and engages with people, groups, or organizations that could impact or be impacted by the project.

   - _What it involves_: Stakeholder identification, planning stakeholder management, engaging stakeholders, and monitoring stakeholder engagement.
   - _Example_: During a hospital information system upgrade, the project manager identifies and analyzes all stakeholders (doctors, nurses, administrators, IT staff, patients) and develops specific engagement strategies for each group to address their concerns and ensure buy-in.

9. **Risk Management**: Involves identifying, analyzing, and responding to project risks.

   - _What it involves_: Risk management planning, risk identification, qualitative and quantitative risk analysis, risk response planning, and risk monitoring and control.
   - _Example_: For an outdoor festival project, the manager creates contingency plans for weather disruptions, including tenting options, schedule flexibility, and insurance coverage, assigning specific team members to monitor weather forecasts as the event approaches.

10. **Cost Management**: Involves processes in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, and controlling costs.
    - _What it involves_: Cost estimation, cost budgeting, and cost control.
    - _Example_: A residential construction project manager develops a detailed budget with separate cost centers for materials, labor, permits, and subcontractors, implementing an earned value management system to track actual costs against planned expenditures throughout the project.

These knowledge areas interact and overlap throughout the project lifecycle. Effective project managers develop competency across all these areas while recognizing when to emphasize particular aspects based on the project's unique characteristics and challenges.

### Predictive vs Adaptive Management

Project management approaches generally fall into two major categories: predictive and adaptive. Understanding when to apply each approach is fundamental to project success.

#### Predictive Management

Predictive management (also known as traditional, conventional, or waterfall project management) works best when:

- The **scope** of work **and requirements** for the project **are clear, stable, and well-understood**
- The technology and methods used are proven and familiar
- Similar projects have been done before, providing historical data
- Regulatory or compliance requirements demand detailed documentation upfront

This approach involves comprehensive planning at the beginning, with the expectation that the plan will remain relatively stable throughout the project lifecycle.

**Key characteristics:**

- Sequential phases with clear deliverables
- Detailed documentation
- Formal change control processes
- Emphasis on following the plan
- Progress measured against the baseline plan

**Popular methodologies:**

- **PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)**: A comprehensive framework from the Project Management Institute (PMI)
- **PRINCE2 (Projects in Controlled Environments)**: A process-based method widely used in government and private sectors
- **Waterfall**: A linear sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins

**Real-world example**: Building a bridge would typically use a predictive approach. The requirements are clear (span the river, support certain weight), the technology is well-established, and changes midway through construction would be extremely costly and potentially dangerous.

#### Adaptive Management

Adaptive management (also known as responsive, iterative, or agile project management) is preferable when:

- The **scope** of work and requirements for the project are difficult to define upfront
- The business environment or technology is rapidly changing
- Innovation and discovery are central to the project
- Quick delivery of business value is prioritized over comprehensive documentation

This approach involves planning in shorter cycles, with the expectation that plans will evolve as more is learned through project execution.

**Key characteristics:**

- Iterative and incremental development
- Requirements clarified in short cycles
- Embraces change as a reality and opportunity
- Emphasizes working deliverables over documentation
- Progress measured by working functionality

**Popular frameworks:**

- **Scrum**: Defines roles, events, and artifacts to guide teams in delivering value in short iterations
- **Kanban**: Visualizes workflow and limits work in progress to optimize flow
- **XP (Extreme Programming)**: Emphasizes technical excellence and customer satisfaction
- **DSDM (Dynamic System Development Method)**: Provides a framework for rapid application development
- **Crystal**: A family of methodologies tailored to team size and project criticality
- **FDD (Feature-Driven Development)**: Focuses on developing features that clients value

**Real-world example**: Developing a new mobile application often uses an adaptive approach. User preferences may change, technology evolves quickly, and releasing early versions allows for valuable user feedback to guide future development.

#### Comparison Table: Predictive vs Adaptive

| Aspect               | Predictive (Traditional)       | Adaptive (Agile)                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Requirements         | Defined upfront                | Emerge and evolve               |
| Documentation        | Comprehensive                  | Just enough                     |
| Planning             | Detailed upfront planning      | Progressive elaboration         |
| Change               | Formal change control          | Embraces change                 |
| Delivery             | Single delivery at project end | Frequent incremental deliveries |
| Team structure       | Hierarchical                   | Self-organizing                 |
| Customer involvement | Mainly at beginning and end    | Continuous throughout           |
| Risk management      | Risk mitigation plans upfront  | Continuous adaptation           |
| Measure of success   | Conformance to plan            | Business value delivered        |

#### Hybrid Approach

In reality, many projects benefit from a thoughtful combination of both approaches. A hybrid approach recognizes that:

- There is no "better" approach, only what fits the specific project you're working on
- Every project is unique and requires a tailored approach with differences in scale, scope, and requirements
- Considering the project characteristics first and _then_ selecting the right methodology is key

**When to consider a hybrid approach:**

- Complex projects with some well-defined requirements and some emerging requirements
- When parts of the project need strict compliance while others benefit from flexibility
- When transitioning from traditional to agile methodologies
- When different teams within the same project have different working styles

**Example of a hybrid approach**: A financial services company developing a new customer portal might use:

- Predictive approach for security features and regulatory compliance components
- Adaptive approach for user interface and customer experience features
- The PMI's PMBOK Guide framework includes considerations for Agile, acknowledging that elements of adaptive approaches can be incorporated into otherwise predictive projects

Remember that methodologies are tools, not dogmas. The best project managers understand the principles behind different approaches and apply them appropriately based on the specific needs of each project.

### Development vs Management

**Interactions between Development and Management:**

<img src="assets/2025-03-23-23-37-04.png" alt="Development vs Management" width="400"/>

### Project Management Overview

#### Essential elements for a successful project

- Delivers as promised.
- Completes on time.
- Completes within budget.
- Delivers quality.
- Achieves original purpose.
- Meets all stakeholder expectations.
- Maintains "win-win" relationships.

#### What is a project?

A project is the work performed by an organization **one time** to produce a **unique** outcome.

- By _one time_, we mean the work has a definite beginning and a definite end.
- By _unique_, we mean the work result is different in one or more ways from anything the organization has produced before.

Examples of projects include the following:

- Building a new house
- Developing a new software application
- Performing an assessment of current manufacturing processes
- Improving an organizational business process
- Writing a book
- Relocating a company's technology infrastructure to a new location or to a cloud platform
- Merging two organizations
- Developing a new medical device

**What is not a project?**

Operational work (operations of an organization) is the ongoing, repetitive set of activities that sustain the organization.

Examples of ongoing operations include the following:

- Processing customer orders
- Performing accounts receivable and accounts payable activities
- Executing daily manufacturing orders
- Performing recommended equipment maintenance procedures
- Conducting customer account maintenance

#### Trends in Project Management

<img src="assets/2025-03-23-23-41-07.png" alt="Trends in Project Management" width="400"/>

Project management continues to evolve in response to changing business environments, technological advancements, and organizational needs. Understanding these trends is essential for modern project managers who need to adapt their approaches and develop relevant skills.

**1. Agile Approaches**

Agile methodologies have fundamentally transformed project management, especially in software development and increasingly in other sectors.

- **Key drivers:**

  - Increasing pace of change in business requirements and market conditions
  - Need to adapt quickly and deliver value incrementally
  - Difficulty in developing detailed upfront plans in complex or innovative domains
  - Customer desire for earlier delivery and more frequent feedback opportunities

- **Real-world impact:**
  A healthcare technology company adopted Scrum for their patient portal development, shifting from 18-month release cycles to 2-week sprints. This allowed them to gather user feedback early, adjust priorities based on changing regulations, and deliver valuable features much sooner than competitors using traditional approaches.

**2. DevOps and DevSecOps Integration**

The integration of development, operations, and security has transformed how technology projects are managed and delivered.

- **Key characteristics:**

  - Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines
  - Automated testing and deployment processes
  - Collaboration between traditionally separate teams (development, operations, security)
  - Emphasis on process automation and transparency

- **Real-world impact:**
  A financial services firm implemented DevSecOps practices, embedding security controls into their deployment pipeline rather than treating security as a final gate. This reduced security-related delays by 70%, allowed for more frequent releases, and improved the overall security posture of their applications.

**3. Product Management Orientation**

Organizations are increasingly shifting from project-based to product-based management approaches for long-lived digital offerings.

- **Key shifts:**

  - Teams organized around products rather than temporary projects
  - Focus on the entire product lifecycle, not just initial development
  - Continuous improvement and evolution rather than fixed endpoints
  - Strategic alignment of resources around product groups

- **Real-world impact:**
  A retail company reorganized from project-based teams to persistent product teams responsible for specific customer journeys (e.g., checkout experience, account management). This eliminated knowledge transfer issues between projects, increased feature delivery speed by 40%, and improved customer satisfaction as teams developed deeper domain expertise.

**4. Cybersecurity Integration**

As cyber threats continue to grow in frequency, scale, and impact, project managers must incorporate security considerations throughout the project lifecycle.

- **Key considerations:**

  - Security requirements integrated into initial planning
  - Regular security assessments during development
  - Security-focused testing prior to deployment
  - Ongoing monitoring and update strategies
  - Compliance with evolving regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

- **Real-world impact:**
  After a data breach affected a competitor, an e-commerce company made cybersecurity a core aspect of all projects. They implemented security checkpoints at each project phase, assigned security champions to each team, and developed a rapid response process for vulnerabilities.

#### Balancing the competing demands

<img src="assets/2025-03-23-23-51-55.png" alt="Balancing the competing demands" width="400"/>

Every project is defined:

- to produce one or more deliverables (_scope_)
- within a defined time period (_time_)
- under an approved budget (_cost_) with a specified set of resources.

The deliverables must achieve a certain performance level (_quality_) and meet the approval of the key stakeholders (_expectations_).

### Roles and Skills of a Project Manager

The project manager (PM) is the driving force behind successful project delivery. This role demands a diverse set of skills and the ability to wear many different "hats" throughout the project lifecycle. Understanding these multifaceted roles is essential for anyone aspiring to excel in project management.

#### The Multiple Roles of a Project Manager

**Planner + Organizer**

The PM establishes the roadmap that will guide the entire project journey. In this role, the project manager:

### User Stories

User stories are a foundational component of agile methodologies, providing a simple yet powerful way to capture requirements from the user's perspective. Unlike traditional requirement documents, user stories emphasize the value delivered to the user and encourage conversation rather than comprehensive documentation.

#### What Are User Stories?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of features told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

> "As a (user role), I want to (action), so that (benefit)."

A complete user story has three essential components, known as the **CCC model**:

- **Card**: A written description of the story, typically on an index card or digital equivalent, serving as a reminder for conversation.
- **Conversation**: Discussions about the story that build shared understanding between the development team and customer, clarifying:
  - **Who**: The specific user role (who will use the feature?)
  - **What**: The desired action or functionality (what do they need to do?)
  - **Why**: The benefit or value (why is this important to them?)
- **Confirmation**: Tests and acceptance criteria that define when the story is complete and working as expected.

#### Examples of Well-Written User Stories

**Simple User Story:**

> "As an online shopper, I want to pay with my credit card, so that I can complete my purchase quickly."

**More Detailed Examples:**

1. **E-commerce Application:**

   > "As a returning customer, I want to save my payment information, so that I can check out faster next time."

   _Acceptance Criteria:_

   - User can opt to save payment information during checkout
   - Saved information is securely stored using encryption
   - User can select saved payment method in future transactions
   - User can delete saved payment information from their account

2. **Task Management App:**

   > "As a project manager, I want to assign tasks to team members, so that responsibilities are clearly defined."

   _Acceptance Criteria:_

   - Tasks can be assigned to one or more team members
   - Assigned team members receive notifications
   - Assignment history is visible in task details
   - Assignments can be changed or removed

3. **Healthcare Portal:**

   > "As a patient, I want to view my upcoming appointments, so that I can prepare and attend them on time."

   _Acceptance Criteria:_

   - Appointments appear in chronological order
   - Each appointment shows date, time, doctor name, and location
   - Calendar view and list view options are available
   - Reminders are sent 24 hours before the appointment

#### The Value of User Stories

User stories offer several advantages over traditional requirements documentation:

1. **Focus on User Value**: By explicitly stating the benefit, stories keep the team focused on delivering value rather than just implementing features.

2. **Encourage Collaboration**: The deliberate incompleteness of a user story card encourages conversation between developers and customers.

3. **Manageable Size**: Good stories are small enough to be completed within a single iteration, making progress visible and manageable.

4. **User-Centered Design**: Stories are written from the user's perspective, helping teams maintain focus on user needs rather than technical implementation.

5. **Flexible Prioritization**: Stories can be easily rearranged and reprioritized as business needs change.

#### Writing Effective User Stories - Practical Tips

1. **Start with Epics**: Begin with larger user stories (epics) and progressively break them down as you approach implementation.

2. **Use Personas**: Create detailed user personas to better understand the "As a..." part of your stories.

3. **Focus on Outcomes, Not Features**: Emphasize what the user wants to accomplish, not how the system should be built.

4. **Keep Technical Details Separate**: User stories should focus on user needs; keep implementation details in technical notes.

5. **Use a Story Map**: Organize stories visually to see how they relate to user workflows and each other.

6. **Include Non-Functional Requirements**: Create stories for performance, security, and usability needs too.

7. **Review and Refine Regularly**: Schedule backlog refinement sessions to improve stories before they're selected for implementation.

#### Common User Story Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Technical Stories**: "As a developer, I want to refactor the authentication module..." focuses on implementation, not user value.

2. **Too Large or Vague**: "As a user, I want a good user experience..." is too abstract to be actionable.

3. **Too Detailed**: Including exact UI specifications in the story limits the team's ability to find the best solution.

4. **Missing Acceptance Criteria**: Without clear confirmation criteria, the team won't know when they've successfully completed the story.

5. **No Clear Value**: If you can't articulate why a user would want a feature, it might not be worth building.

#### Linking User Stories to Business Goals

For maximum effectiveness, user stories should connect to higher-level business objectives:

1. **Themes** → Collections of related user stories
2. **Epics** → Large user stories that need to be broken down
3. **Features** → Groupings of stories that deliver notable user value
4. **User Stories** → Individual slices of functionality
5. **Tasks** → Technical work items needed to implement a story

This hierarchy ensures that even the smallest units of work contribute to the overall business strategy and user needs.

### Roles and Responsibilities

**Developers:**

- Assist customers in formulating clear, valuable stories.
- Clarify how user needs translate into valuable functionality.

**Customers:**

- Write user stories that initiate conversations rather than specifying overly detailed instructions upfront.
- Ensure stories add clear user value, are independent, testable, and well-sized.

**Customer Team:**

- Includes testers, product managers, interaction designers, and real users.
- Writes and prioritizes stories and defines acceptance criteria.
- Writes the story cards because they are in the best position to express the desired features and because they must later be able to work out story details with the developers and to prioritize the stories.

---

### Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests verify whether the developed feature meets the initial story requirements.

**Example (Online Shopping App):**

- Payment tested successfully with Visa, MasterCard, American Express.
- Payment failed with Diner's Club card (which the system does not support).
- Various scenarios: expired cards, debit cards, incorrect or missing security numbers, over-limit transactions.

**Good Practice**: Clearly define acceptance criteria before development to ensure clarity and efficiency.

---

### User Story Lifecycle

<img src="assets/2025-03-24-02-05-49.png" alt="User Story Lifecycle" width="400"/>

A typical user story evolves through stages:

1. **Discovery** (initial understanding of user needs)
2. **Product Backlog** (prioritized user stories)
3. **Release Planning** (stories selected for specific release)
4. **Sprint Planning** (stories broken into detailed tasks)
5. **Sprint Execution** (development and testing)
6. **Acceptance Testing & Delivery**

**Example**:

> Initial Story: "As a shopper, I want a simple checkout, so I can easily complete my purchases."  
> Sprint Backlog Tasks:
>
> - Implement credit card payment gateway.
> - Integrate cart with payment page.
> - Create user-friendly payment confirmation.

---

### Advantages and Disadvantages of User Stories

**Advantages:**

- Force a shift to **verbal communication**.
- Provides **rapid feedback** cycles.
- Are **comprehensible** by both developers and users.
- Are the **right size** for planning.
- Work well with **iterative** development.
- Encourage **deferring details**.
- Encourage **opportunistic development**, in which the team readily shifts focus between high and low levels of detail as opportunities are discovered.
- Encourage **participatory design**, in which users become active and valued participants.

**Disadvantages:**

- On **large projects** it can be **difficult to keep** hundreds or thousands of stories organized; they may need to be augmented with additional documents for traceability.

- **Conversations do not scale** adequately to entirely replace written documents on large projects.

---

### Writing Effective User Stories (INVEST Criteria)

The INVEST criteria, coined by Bill Wake, provide a powerful framework for creating high-quality user stories. Each letter represents a characteristic that effective user stories should possess:

- **I**ndependent
- **N**egotiable
- **V**aluable to users or customers
- **E**stimatable
- **S**mall
- **T**estable

Understanding and applying these criteria can dramatically improve your user stories and, as a result, your project outcomes.

#### Independent

Stories should be self-contained, with minimal dependencies on other stories. This allows for flexibility in implementation order, prioritization, and delivery.

**Why it matters:**

- Enables flexible prioritization based on business value
- Reduces scheduling and planning complexity
- Allows features to be delivered incrementally
- Facilitates parallel development by different team members

**Techniques for increasing independence:**

1. **Split by alternative paths**: Separate stories for different user workflows
2. **Split by interface**: Separate backend and frontend components when appropriate
3. **Split by data type or operation**: Break down by the type of data being processed
4. **Use technical spikes** to resolve dependencies before implementation

**Example of dependent vs. independent stories:**

_Too dependent:_

- "User can search for products" (depends on having products in the system)
- "User can view product details" (depends on search functionality)
- "User can add products to cart" (depends on product detail view)

_Better independent stories:_

- "Admin can add products to the catalog with basic information"
- "User can view a list of available products"
- "User can search for products by name"
- "User can view detailed product information"
- "User can add a product to their shopping cart"

By making each story more independent, teams gain flexibility to implement them in any order that makes sense for business priorities or technical considerations.

#### Negotiable

Stories should be collaborative, leaving room for conversation rather than prescribing detailed specifications. The card serves as a reminder for a conversation, not a comprehensive contract.

**Why it matters:**

- Encourages collaboration between business and technical team members
- Allows for creative problem-solving during implementation
- Prevents overspecification that might constrain technical solutions
- Adapts to emerging understanding as the project progresses

**Characteristics of negotiable stories:**

1. Capture intent without prescribing implementation details
2. Avoid technical specifications in the story description
3. Focus on outcomes rather than features
4. Remain open to alternative approaches

**Example of non-negotiable vs. negotiable stories:**

_Too prescriptive (non-negotiable):_
| Don't: |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src="assets/2025-03-24-02-16-50.png" alt="Bad Example" width="400"/> |

_Better negotiable story:_
| Do: |

The negotiable version focuses on what the user needs to accomplish, leaving room for the team to determine the best implementation approach during development.

#### Valuable

Each story must deliver clear value to end-users or customers. Technical stories should be reframed to emphasize the business or user value they provide.

**Why it matters:**

- Ensures development effort contributes to project goals
- Helps prioritize work based on business impact
- Makes it easier to explain the purpose to stakeholders
- Keeps the team focused on delivering outcomes, not just outputs

**Tips for ensuring stories are valuable:**

1. Always include the "so that..." part explaining the benefit
2. Link stories to business objectives or key performance indicators
3. Consider who benefits from the story and how
4. Avoid technical implementation details unless they directly provide user value

**Example of technical vs. valuable stories:**

_Too technical (not clearly valuable):_
| Don't: |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src="assets/2025-03-24-02-18-29.png" alt="Bad Example" width="400"/> |

_Better value-focused story:_
| Do: |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src="assets/2025-03-24-02-18-37.png" alt="Good Example" width="400"/> |

The valuable version clearly explains why this capability matters to users, while the technical version only describes an implementation approach without explaining its purpose.

#### Estimable (Handling Uncertainty)

Teams need to be able to estimate the effort required to implement a story with reasonable accuracy. If a story cannot be estimated, it typically indicates deeper issues.

**Why estimation might be difficult:**

- Lack of clarity on requirements or acceptance criteria
- Developers lack domain knowledge about the business problem
- Development team lacks technical expertise in the required area
- The story is too large or complex (an epic rather than a story)

**Approaches to make stories more estimable:**

1. **Break down complex stories** into smaller, more manageable pieces
2. **Conduct research spikes** before estimation:

   - **Functional Spike** (focused on _what?_): Analyzes solution behavior to determine:

     - How to break down the work
     - How to organize implementation
     - Where risk and complexity exist
     - How to influence implementation decisions

   - **Technical Spike** (focused on _how?_): Researches technical approaches to:
     - Evaluate build-versus-buy decisions
     - Assess performance implications
     - Test technical implementation approaches
     - Build confidence in solution paths

**Example of estimation challenges and solutions:**

_Difficult to estimate (epic):_

> "As a consumer, I want to see my daily energy use in a histogram so that I can quickly understand my past, current, and projected energy consumption."

_Research spikes to improve estimability:_

> "Prototype energy usage histogram to validate visual clarity." (Functional Spike)
> "Test API response times for historical energy data to assess real-time dashboard feasibility." (Technical Spike)

_Resulting more estimable stories:_

> "As a consumer, I want to view a simple histogram of my daily energy usage for the current month."
> "As a consumer, I want to compare my current month's energy usage with the previous month."
> "As a consumer, I want to see predicted energy usage based on my consumption patterns."

#### Small (Splitting Epics)

Stories should be right-sized—large enough to deliver meaningful value but small enough to complete within a single iteration. Large stories (epics) should be split into smaller, manageable pieces.

**Benefits of smaller stories:**

- More accurate estimation
- Faster feedback cycles
- Greater flexibility in planning
- Increased visibility of progress
- Reduced risk of "90% done" syndrome

**Patterns for splitting user stories:**

1. **Split by workflow steps**: Break a complex workflow into individual steps
2. **Split by user roles**: Separate functionality by different types of users
3. **Split by CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete as separate stories
4. **Split by happy path vs. edge cases**: Main functionality first, then special cases
5. **Split by data variations**: Different types of data processed by the same function
6. **Split by quality attributes**: Core functionality first, then performance or security enhancements

**Real-world example of splitting epics:**

_Original epic (too large):_

> "User can manage job search profiles."

_Split by operations:_

- "A user can **create** resumes, which include education, prior jobs, salary history, publications, presentations, community service, and an objective."
- "A user can **edit** a resume."
- "A user can **delete** a resume."
- "A user can **have multiple** resumes."
- "A user can **activate and inactivate** resumes."

_Split by data elements:_

- "A user can add and edit **education information**."
- "A user can add and edit **job history information**."
- "A user can add and edit **salary history information**."
- "A user can add and edit **publications**."
- "A user can add and edit **presentations**."
- "A user can add and edit **community service**."
- "A user can add and edit **an objective**."

_Another example of splitting an epic:_

_Original epic:_

> "A user can search for jobs."

_Breaking down the epic requires considering:_

- What attributes can users search on? Location? Salary? Job title?
- Does the user need to be registered?
- Can search parameters be saved for future use?
- What information is displayed in search results?

_Resulting smaller stories:_

- "A user can search for jobs by location (city, state, country)."
- "A user can search for jobs by salary range."
- "A user can search for jobs by job title, company name, and posting date."
- "A user can view a list of jobs matching their search criteria."
- "A user can view detailed information about a job from search results."
- "A registered user can save search criteria for future use."

#### Testable

Every story must have clear criteria that determine when it is complete and functioning correctly. If a story cannot be tested, it cannot be verified as done.

**Characteristics of testable stories:**

- Clear acceptance criteria defined before development begins
- Specific, measurable outcomes that can be verified
- Objective rather than subjective criteria
- Automated tests can be written to verify functionality

**Making stories more testable:**

1. Define acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then format
2. Include specific examples of expected behavior
3. Consider both positive and negative test cases
4. Specify quantifiable metrics for non-functional requirements

**Example of non-testable vs. testable stories:**

_Not sufficiently testable:_

> "The system should feel fast and responsive to users."

_Better testable version:_

> "User can export order history as CSV, with the export completing in under 3 seconds for up to 1,000 orders."
>
> Acceptance Criteria:
>
> - Given a user with 1,000 orders, when they export order history, then a CSV file downloads in less than 3 seconds
> - The CSV includes order ID, date, total, and status for each order
> - Column headers are included in the first row of the CSV
> - Orders are sorted by date (newest first)

The testable version provides specific, measurable criteria that can be verified through automated or manual testing.

#### Practical Exercise: Applying INVEST to Improve User Stories

To practice applying the INVEST criteria, follow these steps with your existing or new user stories:

1. **Evaluate** each story against all six INVEST criteria
2. **Identify** which criteria are not being met
3. **Rewrite** the story to address the deficiencies
4. **Review** with team members to ensure the improved story is understood

**Before INVEST application:**

> "Implement password reset functionality."

**After INVEST application:**

> "As a registered user who has forgotten my password, I want to securely reset my password through email verification, so that I can regain access to my account without contacting support."
>
> Acceptance Criteria:
>
> - User can request password reset from login screen
> - System sends email with secure, time-limited reset link (valid for 1 hour)
> - User can create a new password that meets security requirements
> - User is notified upon successful password change
> - Old password no longer works after reset

The improved story is independent, clearly negotiable, valuable to users, estimable by the team, appropriately sized, and has testable acceptance criteria.

By consistently applying the INVEST criteria to your user stories, you'll create a more effective product backlog that leads to better planning, development, and ultimately, a more successful product.
