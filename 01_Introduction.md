## D2. Areas, tasks and modalities in project management

### Introduction to Project Management

Project Management (PM) involves planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals.

### Knowledge Areas of Project Management

Top 10 PM Knowledge Areas:

1. **Integration Management**: Coordinate project activities across all areas.
2. **Scope Management**: Ensure all necessary project elements are included.
3. **Time Management**: Timely completion of project activities.
4. **Quality Management**: Ensure outputs meet user needs and standards.
5. **Resource Management**: Efficiently manage and monitor project resources.
6. **Communications Management**: Effective planning and implementation of communications.
7. **Procurement Management**: Manage purchasing and contracts.
8. **Stakeholder Management**: Actively engage stakeholders.
9. **Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate potential risks.
10. **Cost Management**: Control financial resources effectively.

### Predictive vs Adaptive Management

#### Predictive Management

- The **scope** of work **and requirements** for the project **are clear** and justify the detailed upfront planning.
- Also called traditional, conventional or waterfall project management.
- Popular methodologies:
  - PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)
  - PRINCE2 (Projects in Controlled Environments)
  - Waterfall

#### Adaptive Management

The **scope** of work and requirements for the project are difficult to define.

- Rapidly changing environment.
- Requirements are clarified in short iterations.
- Also referred to as responsive, iterative or agile project management.
- Frameworks include:
  - Scrum
  - Kanban
  - XP (Extreme programming)
  - DSDM (Dynamic system development method)
  - Crystal
  - FDD (Feature-driven development)

#### Hybrid Approach

- There is no "better" approach, only what fits the project you`re working on.
- Every project is unique and requires a tailored approach. You will find differences in scale, scope and requirements.
- Considering the project first and _then_ selection the right methodology is key.

Choosing a **hybrid approach** allows you to combine the best of both worlds, leveraging the strengths of predictive and adaptive methodologies.

- Predictive and adaptive approaches can work well together.
- You may choose a hybrid of methodologies to get the best result for your project (for example PRINCE2 combine with Agile).
- The PMI's PMBOK Guide framework includes a consideration for Agile, giving you room to incorporate elements of adaptive into your predictive project work.

### Development vs Management

**Interactions between Development and Management:**

<img src="assets/2025-03-23-23-37-04.png" alt="Development vs Management" width="400"/>

### Project Management Overview

#### Essential elements for a successful project

- Delivers as promised.
- Completes on time.
- Completes within budget.
- Delivers quality.
- Achieves original purpose.
- Meets all stakeholder expectations.
- Maintains “win-win” relationships.

#### What is a project?

A project is the work performed by an organization **one time** to produce a **unique** outcome.

- By _one time_, we mean the work has a definite beginning and a definite end.
- By _unique_, we mean the work result is different in one or more ways from anything the organization has produced before.

Examples of projects include the following:

- Building a new house
- Developing a new software application
- Performing an assessment of current manufacturing processes
- Improving an organizational business process
- Writing a book
- Relocating a company’s technology infrastructure to a new location or to a cloud platform
- Merging two organizations
- Developing a new medical device

**What is not a project?**

Operational work (operations of an organization) is the ongoing, repetitive set of activities that sustain the organization.

Examples of ongoing operations include the following:

- Processing customer orders
- Performing accounts receivable and accounts payable activities
- Executing daily manufacturing orders
- Performing recommended equipment maintenance procedures
- Conducting customer account maintenance

### The project manager

<a href="https://www.testgorilla.com/blog/project-manager-skills/">12 essential skills for project managers</a>

#### Hard skills

- **Budgeting and financial management**. They need to be sharp with numbers, create accurate budgets, keep an eye on spending, and make sure money and resources are used wisely to keep projects on track and within budget.
- **Knowledge of project management frameworks**. They should know their way around different project management methods. This helps them pick the best approach for each project and tweak their plans as things change.
- **Resource management**. They handle everything from their team to equipment and supplies. They need to use these resources wisely – without wasting time or money – to get the best results.
- **Documentation and reporting**. Keeping detailed records and updating everyone on progress is a big part of their job. It keeps things transparent and helps with audits – enabling them to show that project activities comply with established standards and regulations.

#### Soft skills

- **Adaptability and problem-solving**. They have to think on their feet, come up with solutions quickly, and adjust to new challenges to keep things moving smoothly.
- **Emotional intelligence**. Understanding and managing emotions helps PM work well with others, build trust, keep the team motivated, and resolve any issues in a positive way.

### Involvement vs commitment

<img src="assets/2025-03-24-00-41-37.png" alt="Involvement vs commitment" width="400"/>

In a bacon-and-egg breakfast, what’s the difference between the chicken and the pig?

- The chicken is **involved**, but the pig is **committed**.

Is this the reason why this course is called PIGS?

## D3. Product Backlog

### User Stories

User stories are simple descriptions of features from the user's perspective, emphasizing value to the user. A complete user story has three components, known as the **CCC** (Card, Conversation, Confirmation):

- **Card**: Written description.
- **Conversation**: Discussions for clarity and detail.
- **Confirmation**: Tests ensuring completion criteria are met.

#### Example User Story Structure:

> “As a (user role), I want to (action), so that (benefit).”

- **Example**: “As an online shopper, I want to pay with my credit card, so that I can complete my purchase quickly.”

### Roles and Responsibilities

**Developers:**

- Assist customers in formulating clear, valuable stories.
- Clarify how user needs translate into valuable functionality.

**Customers:**

- Write user stories that initiate conversations rather than specifying overly detailed instructions upfront.
- Ensure stories add clear user value, are independent, testable, and well-sized.

**Customer Team:**

- Includes testers, product managers, interaction designers, and real users.
- Writes and prioritizes stories and defines acceptance criteria.

---

### Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests verify whether the developed feature meets the initial story requirements.

**Example (Online Shopping App):**

- Payment tested successfully with Visa, MasterCard, American Express.
- Payment failed with Diner’s Club card (which the system does not support).
- Various scenarios: expired cards, debit cards, incorrect or missing security numbers, over-limit transactions.

**Good Practice**: Clearly define acceptance criteria before development to ensure clarity and efficiency.

---

### User Story Lifecycle

A typical user story evolves through stages:

1. **Discovery** (initial understanding of user needs)
2. **Product Backlog** (prioritized user stories)
3. **Release Planning** (stories selected for specific release)
4. **Sprint Planning** (stories broken into detailed tasks)
5. **Sprint Execution** (development and testing)
6. **Acceptance Testing & Delivery**

**Example**:

> Initial Story: “As a shopper, I want a simple checkout, so I can easily complete my purchases.”  
> Sprint Backlog Tasks:
>
> - Implement credit card payment gateway.
> - Integrate cart with payment page.
> - Create user-friendly payment confirmation.

---

### Advantages and Disadvantages of User Stories

**Advantages:**

- Encourages direct communication and rapid feedback.
- Understandable by technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Suited for iterative (agile) development.
- Encourages user participation and detail flexibility.

**Disadvantages:**

- Challenging to scale for large projects.
- Additional documentation might be needed for traceability in extensive projects.

---

### Writing Effective User Stories (INVEST Criteria)

Created by Bill Wake, the INVEST criteria help ensure high-quality user stories:

| Criterion   | Explanation                                                 | Example                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Independent | Minimal dependency on other stories.                        | Separate payment by Visa, MasterCard, AMEX into individual stories. |
| Negotiable  | Details finalized through customer-developer conversations. | Acceptance criteria detailed on story cards.                        |
| Valuable    | Delivers clear value to end-user or customer.               | Storing payment info speeds future checkouts.                       |
| Estimatable | Team can estimate effort accurately.                        | Conduct technical/functional spikes for unclear areas.              |
| Small       | Sized appropriately; too large (epics) should be split.     | “User can manage resume” → “User can create/edit/delete resume.”    |
| Testable    | Can clearly define pass/fail criteria.                      | “User can export order history as CSV.”                             |

---

### Clarifying Examples (INVEST Criteria Applied)

- **Independent**:  
  Instead of "User can pay by credit card," create independent stories like:

  - "User pays by Visa"
  - "User pays by MasterCard"

- **Negotiable**:  
  Initially vague "User manages account details" refined after discussions:

  - "User updates shipping address"
  - "User changes saved payment method"

- **Valuable**:  
  Avoid vague technical requirements. Instead:

  - "User can view error messages easily (user value)"  
    Rather than "System uses common logging classes (technical detail)."

- **Estimatable** (Handling Uncertainty):  
  Use spikes (research-oriented tasks):
  - **Functional Spike**: Prototype UI to gather user feedback.
  - **Technical Spike**: Research third-party APIs for integration feasibility.

**Spike Examples**:

- "Prototype energy usage histogram to validate visual clarity." (Functional Spike)
- "Test API response times to assess real-time dashboard feasibility." (Technical Spike)

- **Small** (Splitting Epics):  
  Large stories ("epics") divided into smaller stories:  
  Original epic: "User can manage job search profiles."  
  Smaller stories:

  - "User creates new job search profiles."
  - "User edits existing profiles."
  - "User deletes profiles."

- **Testable**:  
  Clearly defined acceptance criteria:
  - Good: "User can export order history as CSV."
  - Poor: "System feels fast and responsive."

---

### Real-world Example: Bookshop Application

**Example User Stories:**

- **Search**:

  - "User searches books by title, author, ISBN."
  - "User views detailed book info (pages, description)."

- **Purchase**:

  - "User adds/removes books from cart."
  - "User completes checkout with credit card."

- **User Accounts**:

  - "User creates account with saved payment and shipping details."
  - "User edits account info."

- **Additional Features**:
  - "User creates visible wish lists."
  - "User writes and submits book reviews."

**Constraints (special considerations)**:

- "System supports peak use of up to 50 concurrent users."
- "Order records integrate seamlessly with telephone orders."

---

### Study Notes & Good Practices

- Keep user stories concise; use conversations to elaborate.
- Always prioritize stories by user value.
- Regularly review acceptance criteria clarity and completeness.
- Use spikes for uncertainty; they're an essential agile practice.
- Document essential details clearly to avoid misunderstandings.
