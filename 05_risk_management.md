## D9. Exposure, taxonomy and discovery

Effective risk management begins with understanding what risk is, how to measure its impact, and how to classify and identify it within a project environment. This section introduces foundational concepts, practical classification systems (taxonomy), and structured strategies for risk discovery.

---

### 🔍 What Is a Risk?

- A **risk** is a possible future event that may lead to an **undesirable outcome**.
  *📝 Nota (ES):* *Riesgo* → “posible problema futuro”; *Problem* → “riesgo materializado”.  
  🔍 **Ejemplo:** Un fallo de integración con la API de pagos *podría* ocurrir (riesgo). Si efectivamente bloquea las transacciones en producción, ya es un *problem*.
- A **problem** is a risk that has already materialized.
- Risks are defined by two key properties:
  - **Uncertainty** – the event may or may not happen.
  - **Potential loss** – if it does happen, it will have negative consequences.

**Why this matters:** Understanding risk as a *pre-problem* enables early action, rather than reacting once damage has occurred.

---

### ⚖️ Risk vs. Crisis Management

- **Risk Management** involves identifying and mitigating risks *before* they happen.
- **Crisis Management** is reactive, dealing with consequences *after* a risk becomes a problem.

> **Metaphor:** Risk management is like installing smoke detectors and fire sprinklers. Crisis management is calling the fire department once the building is already burning.

---

### 🔄 Risk Transition

A **risk transition** is when a potential risk becomes a **real problem**.

- **Transition indicators** are early warning signs that a risk may materialize.
- It’s acceptable to have **false positives** — better safe than sorry.

---

### 📊 Risk Exposure

**Definition:** Risk exposure is a quantitative way to evaluate risk severity.

$$$
\text{Risk Exposure} = \text{Probability} \times \text{Cost}
$$$

📝 Nota (ES): *Risk Exposure* se traduce comúnmente como **“exposición al riesgo”**.  
💻 Dev‑Note: en un sprint planning, puedes estimar la *exposición al riesgo* de un nuevo micro‑servicio multiplicando la probabilidad de fallo de despliegue (por ej. 15 %) por el tiempo de rollback (por ej. 4 h) ≈ 0,6 h de colchón que deberías reflejar en la story.

- **Cost** can be expressed in money, time, or other measurable impacts.
- Helps prioritize which risks are worth managing actively.

**Example:**

> A risk has a 20% chance of occurring and would cost €1,000,000 if it does.
>
> Risk Exposure = 0.2 × 1,000,000 = €200,000

---

### 🔥 Showstopper Risks

- **High-impact risks** that, if they occur, would force cancellation or complete redesign of a project.
- They cannot be effectively mitigated and must be managed through **project assumptions** (e.g., "assume this won’t happen").
- Still tracked, but not actively managed.

---

### 🎯 Why Risk Management?

- Bounds uncertainty
- Makes risk-taking strategic, not reckless
- Prevents blame games by making risk visible
- Ensures attention goes where it matters most
- Encourages team growth through ownership

---

### 🧭 Risk Taxonomy

Categorizing risks helps structure discovery and responsibility. PMBOK and industry practice define **four broad risk families**, each with subtypes:

| Category         | Examples |
|------------------|----------|
| **Technical**    | Requirements volatility, integration issues, high complexity |
| **Management**   | Poor estimation, communication breakdowns, unclear priorities |
| **Organizational** | Budget shortfalls, lack of staff, policy conflicts |
| **External**     | Supplier failures, regulatory changes, market instability |

> **Tip:** Use the taxonomy to build a checklist or brainstorming guide.

💻 Dev‑Note: Puedes convertir cada categoría en etiquetas de tu issue tracker (Jira, GitHub Projects, etc.) para filtrar rápidamente *bugs* con alto componente técnico frente a riesgos externos como proveedores de CDN.

---

### ⚠️ Risk Categories – Expanded View

#### 1. Technical Risks (Product)
- Ambiguous or unstable requirements
- Technological uncertainty or obsolescence
- Complex or poorly integrated design
- Quality and performance shortfalls

#### 2. Management Risks (Project)
- Inaccurate planning or estimation
- Role confusion, weak leadership
- Scope creep and poor change control
- Lack of team communication

#### 3. Organizational Risks (Business)
- Budget or staffing limitations
- Vague decision-making authority
- Delays in approvals or procurement

#### 4. External Risks
- Regulatory shifts
- Supplier reliability
- Weather or natural disaster
- Changing customer needs

---

### 🧠 Risk Discovery

Common obstacles that prevent teams from identifying risks:
- Fear of being seen as negative
- Belief that raising a risk implies owning the solution
- Hesitation without absolute proof

#### Key Strategy: **Postmortem Mining**
- Analyze past projects (successful and failed)
- Identify unexpected deviations
- Trace them to their root causes
- Reframe those causes as *future risks* for upcoming projects

#### Key Strategy: **6-3-5 Brainwriting**
- 6 people, 3 ideas each, passed on 5 times
- Generates 108 risk ideas in ~30 minutes

---

### ❌ Risks You Can Ignore

Not all risks are worth managing:

- Extremely low probability or minimal impact
- If they occur, the project becomes irrelevant
- They belong to external parties (e.g., client, regulator)

Still, document these in a *risk backlog* with clear justification.

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways

- Risks are future problems: manage them proactively
- Quantify exposure to prioritize mitigation
- Use taxonomies to systematically uncover risk areas
- Don’t ignore the human side—fear and ambiguity block discovery
- Use structured strategies (e.g., postmortems, brainwriting) to ensure completeness

---

## D10. Uncertainty, mitigation and contingency

Risk management is incomplete without understanding *uncertainty*—its origins, implications, and strategies to reduce or absorb its impact. This section covers sources of uncertainty, techniques for quantifying it, and two essential risk response strategies: **mitigation** and **contingency**.

---

### 🌫️ Understanding Uncertainty

**Uncertainty** is the absence of complete certainty about future events or conditions that could impact a project. Unlike risk, which is quantifiable, uncertainty may not yet be fully understood or measurable.

**Common Sources of Uncertainty:**
- **Requirements**: Incomplete or evolving expectations
- **Human-System Interaction**: Unknowns in usability and operational integration
- **Changing Environment**: Shifting goals during the development timeline
- **Resource Availability**: Unpredictability in staffing and skills
- **Management Performance**: Team cohesion, coordination, and morale
- **Supply Chain**: Dependability of external partners
- **Politics**: Government or corporate decisions influencing scope or feasibility
- **Conflict**: Misalignment among stakeholder goals
- **Innovation**: New or experimental technologies
- **Scaling**: Risks introduced when moving beyond known operational scope

---

### 📐 Quantifying Uncertainty

**Challenge**: Project managers often forecast tasks that *must* be done, but not tasks that *might* be needed.

#### 🎯 Schedule Uncertainty
Release dates often fall within a **probability window**. Organizations with inconsistent processes have wider windows.

**Heuristic for software projects:**
- Best-case = N
- Realistic delivery = between N and the goal
- Published schedule = outer limit

#### 🧩 Functional Uncertainty
Sometimes, the **delivery date is fixed**, but what gets delivered is flexible—functionality becomes the uncertain factor.

---

### 🛠️ Risk Response Strategies

| Strategy     | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Avoid**    | Don’t do the task that entails the risk. You lose potential benefits. |
| **Contain**  | Set aside buffer (time, money) to absorb the impact if the risk happens. |
| **Mitigate** | Take actions beforehand to reduce either the probability or cost of a risk. |
| **Evade**    | Let the risk expire or resolve itself without incurring cost. |

---

### 🔁 Mitigation vs Contingency

| Aspect              | **Mitigation Plan**                                      | **Contingency Plan**                                   |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Timing              | Preemptive                                               | Reactive                                                |
| Investment          | Resources spent *in advance*                             | Resources *reserved*, not yet spent                    |
| Goal                | Reduce probability or impact                             | Control impact if risk materializes                    |
| Example             | Refactoring risky module early                           | Having extra devs on call when deadline slips          |

> **Tip:** Mitigation is your first line of defense. Contingency is your fallback plan.

📝 Nota (ES):  
* **Mitigación** = “prevenir o reducir impacto/probabilidad” (trabajo *up‑front*).  
* **Contingencia** = “plan B” listo para activarse si la cosa se complica.

💻 Dev‑Note: piensa en **tests automatizados** (mitigación) vs. **feature‑flag para rollback rápido** (contingencia).

---

### 💰 Risk Reserve

A **risk reserve** is a buffer of time and money **set aside** to contain materialized risks.

**Best practice:**
- Calculate expected exposure across all risks
- Set aside reserve approximately equal to that total
- Adjust reserve based on organizational risk tolerance

> More defensive = allocate more than expected exposure  
> Less defensive = allocate less than expected exposure

**Mitigation reduces required reserves, but introduces fixed upfront costs.**

🔍 **Ejemplo:** Tu equipo guarda 3 días de buffer en el sprint. Tras añadir tests de contrato (mitigación) el buffer se reduce a 1 día, pero ya no necesitas tantas horas de soporte durante el release.

---

### 🧭 Transition Indicators

For each managed risk:
- Choose **early warning signals**
- Accept **some false positives**
- Balance **cost of early action vs. cost of delay**

---

### 💡 Real-World Examples of Risk Mitigation

#### 1. **Estimation & Scheduling**
- Involve team in estimation
- Work in short iterations to improve velocity transparency
- Monitor and apply lessons from current projects

#### 2. **Requirements Inflation**
- Involve customers early
- Use iterative reprioritization instead of blocking changes

#### 3. **Employee Turnover**
- Apply pair programming, shared code ownership, team rituals
- Create a culture that retains talent

#### 4. **Specification Breakdown**
- Use a product manager or proxy
- Run JAD (Joint Application Design) sessions to enhance specifications

#### 5. **Poor Productivity**
- Time-box with short sprints
- Stick to realistic schedules
- Use small, focused teams

#### 6. **Budget Overrun**
- Use rolling-wave planning to avoid front-loading decisions
- Expect and manage pivots during product evolution

#### 7. **Knowledge Silos**
- Use squad-based development
- Encourage documentation, shared ownership, and mentoring

---

### 🧨 Common Procedural Risks

- **Design shortcuts**: Skipping detailed design wastes time later
- **Gold plating**: Adding unneeded features burns budget
- **Reduced functionality**: Trimming scope to meet deadlines can hurt quality
- **Operational misalignment**: Poor process clarity or conflicting roles slow execution

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways

- Uncertainty is inevitable—don’t ignore it, plan for it
- Use both mitigation (prevention) and contingency (response)
- Keep risk reserves proportional to project size and risk profile
- Transition indicators should trigger risk responses early
- Address root causes in estimation, knowledge sharing, and requirements clarity
