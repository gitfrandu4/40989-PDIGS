## Introduction

Key points from Introduction to Project Management:

**Market Research and SWOT Analysis:**

- Executive Summary includes product description, market analysis, and team composition
- SWOT identifies internal Strengths/Weaknesses and external Opportunities/Threats
- Project objectives should follow SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Rewarding, Time-based)

**Project Management Approaches:**

- Knowledge areas include Integration, Scope, Time, Quality, Resource, Communications, Risk, and Cost Management
- Predictive (waterfall) approaches work when requirements are clear; Adaptive (agile) approaches for evolving requirements
- Hybrid methodologies combine elements from both approaches based on project needs
- Project management trends include agile, DevOps, mobile technologies, and virtual team management

**Project Manager Roles:**

- Project managers serve as Planners, Organizers, Coaches, Problem Solvers, and Communicators
- Essential skills include budgeting, resource management, emotional intelligence, and conflict resolution
- Common mistakes include poor stakeholder management and unclear responsibility assignment

**Product Backlog Management:**

- User stories follow "As a [role], I want [action], so that [benefit]" format
- INVEST criteria ensures stories are Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable
- Spikes (research tasks) help resolve uncertainty in requirements or implementation approaches
- User stories evolve through discovery, planning, execution, and acceptance testing

## Estimation

Key points from Software Project Estimation:

**Basic Concepts and Challenges:**

- Software estimation faces unique challenges compared to other industries due to productivity variations, requirement volatility, and continuous innovation
- Estimation requires both accuracy (closeness to true value) and precision (consistency of measurements)
- The "Ninety-Ninety Rule" highlights common optimism in project estimation: first 90% takes 90% of time, last 10% also takes 90%

**Estimation Phases and Components:**

- Size Estimation: Determining project scale and complexity
- Effort Estimation: Calculating required time and personnel resources
- Cost Estimation: Budgeting for all necessary resources
- Productivity assessment is crucial and affected by team experience, work environment, and project complexity

**Metrics in Software Estimation:**

- Size-based metrics: Lines of code, number of modules, documentation pages
- Function-based metrics: Function points, object points, use case points, story points
- Pros of function-based metrics include language independence and early application in development

**Estimation Techniques:**

- Expert Judgment: Leverages experience and tacit knowledge
- Delphi Method: Structured expert consensus through anonymous feedback loops
- Historical/Analogous: Based on data from similar past projects
- Parametric/Algorithmic: Uses mathematical models derived from historical data
- Decomposition: Breaks project into smaller, more easily estimable units
- Phased Estimation: Provides detailed estimates for immediate phases, broader estimates for future phases

**Agile Estimation Approaches:**

- Planning Poker uses team consensus with Fibonacci sequence for complexity estimation
- User stories estimated in story points representing relative complexity
- Prioritization using MoSCoW method (Must, Should, Could, Won't have)
- Burndown charts track progress against estimations

**Cost Estimation and Pricing:**

- Multiple pricing models: Cost-plus, Opportunity, Going Rate, Monopolistic, Loss Leader
- Per-person-hour cost calculation: Direct costs + Overhead costs
- Overhead includes indirect staff, facilities, utilities, and organizational expenses
- Employee cost analysis must account for gross salary, taxes, and additional contributions

## Planning

Planning encompasses defining project scope, creating work breakdown structures, scheduling activities, and allocating resources. It involves both predictive approaches (traditional/waterfall) and adaptive methodologies (agile) depending on the clarity of requirements and project environment.

## Risk management

Risk management focuses on identifying potential risks, analyzing their impact, and developing mitigation strategies. This ongoing process includes risk identification, assessment, response planning, and continuous monitoring throughout the project lifecycle.

## Software quality

Software quality management ensures that project deliverables meet defined standards and user requirements. It involves quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control processes that maintain the integrity of software products.

## Standards

Modern project management relies on established standards and methodologies to ensure consistency, quality, and successful outcomes. Below is a summary of key standards and when to use each:

**1. Métrica 3**

- **Purpose:** Methodology for planning, developing, and maintaining information systems, especially in Spain's public sector.
- **When to use:** Public IT projects in Spain or where legal/traceability requirements are strict.
- **Key features:** Phase-based, strong documentation, quality gates, based on ISO/IEC standards.

**2. PRINCE2**

- **Purpose:** Structured project management method emphasizing control, roles, and stage boundaries.
- **When to use:** Projects needing formal control, documentation, and clear governance (e.g., government, large organizations).
- **Key features:** Business case focus, stage reviews, adaptable to traditional and agile projects.

**3. Scrum**

- **Purpose:** Agile framework for iterative, incremental product development.
- **When to use:** Fast-changing environments, startups, or feature-driven teams needing adaptability.
- **Key features:** Sprints, roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team), artifacts (backlogs, burndown charts), regular reviews.

**4. Extreme Programming (XP)**

- **Purpose:** Agile methodology focused on engineering practices for high-quality code.
- **When to use:** Teams prioritizing technical excellence, rapid feedback, and frequent releases.
- **Key features:** Test-driven development, pair programming, continuous integration.

**5. Lean Software Development**

- **Purpose:** Minimize waste and maximize value in software delivery.
- **When to use:** Projects seeking efficiency, rapid delivery, and continuous improvement.
- **Key features:** Eliminate waste, empower teams, deliver fast, build quality in.

**6. Kanban**

- **Purpose:** Visual workflow management to optimize flow and limit work in progress.
- **When to use:** Maintenance, support, DevOps, or teams seeking incremental process improvement.
- **Key features:** Visual boards, WIP limits, evolutionary change.

**7. PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)**

- **Purpose:** Comprehensive framework covering all aspects of project management.
- **When to use:** Large, complex projects or portfolios needing structured processes and best practices.
- **Key features:** Process groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing), 10 knowledge areas (scope, time, cost, quality, etc.), RACI matrices.

**Choosing a Methodology:**

- Consider project size, complexity, regulatory needs, and stakeholder involvement.
- Métrica 3: Public sector IT in Spain.
- Scrum/XP: Fast-paced, product-focused teams.
- PRINCE2: Projects needing control and documentation.
- Lean/Kanban: Continuous delivery, maintenance, or process improvement.
- PMBOK: Comprehensive oversight for large or complex initiatives.
- Tailor your approach—combine elements as needed for your project's context.
