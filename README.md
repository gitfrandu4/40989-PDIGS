## Introduction

Key points from Introduction to Project Management:

**Market Research and SWOT Analysis:**

- Executive Summary includes product description, market analysis, and team composition
- SWOT identifies internal Strengths/Weaknesses and external Opportunities/Threats
- Project objectives should follow SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Rewarding, Time-based)

**Project Management Approaches:**

- Knowledge areas include Integration, Scope, Time, Quality, Resource, Communications, Risk, and Cost Management
- Predictive (waterfall) approaches work when requirements are clear; Adaptive (agile) approaches for evolving requirements
- Hybrid methodologies combine elements from both approaches based on project needs
- Project management trends include agile, DevOps, mobile technologies, and virtual team management

**Project Manager Roles:**

- Project managers serve as Planners, Organizers, Coaches, Problem Solvers, and Communicators
- Essential skills include budgeting, resource management, emotional intelligence, and conflict resolution
- Common mistakes include poor stakeholder management and unclear responsibility assignment

**Product Backlog Management:**

- User stories follow "As a [role], I want [action], so that [benefit]" format
- INVEST criteria ensures stories are Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable
- Spikes (research tasks) help resolve uncertainty in requirements or implementation approaches
- User stories evolve through discovery, planning, execution, and acceptance testing

## Estimation

Estimation in project management involves determining resource requirements, including time, cost, and effort needed to complete a project. Effective estimation requires understanding project scope, breaking down work into manageable components, and applying appropriate estimation techniques.

## Planning

Planning encompasses defining project scope, creating work breakdown structures, scheduling activities, and allocating resources. It involves both predictive approaches (traditional/waterfall) and adaptive methodologies (agile) depending on the clarity of requirements and project environment.

## Risk management

Risk management focuses on identifying potential risks, analyzing their impact, and developing mitigation strategies. This ongoing process includes risk identification, assessment, response planning, and continuous monitoring throughout the project lifecycle.

## Software quality

Software quality management ensures that project deliverables meet defined standards and user requirements. It involves quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control processes that maintain the integrity of software products.

## Standards

Project management standards provide frameworks and best practices for consistent project execution. Common standards include PMI's PMBOK, PRINCE2, and various agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, and XP that guide project governance and execution.
