## Introduction

Key points from Introduction to Project Management:

**Market Research and SWOT Analysis:**

- Executive Summary includes product description, market analysis, and team composition
- SWOT identifies internal Strengths/Weaknesses and external Opportunities/Threats
- Project objectives should follow SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Rewarding, Time-based)

**Project Management Approaches:**

- Knowledge areas include Integration, Scope, Time, Quality, Resource, Communications, Risk, and Cost Management
- Predictive (waterfall) approaches work when requirements are clear; Adaptive (agile) approaches for evolving requirements
- Hybrid methodologies combine elements from both approaches based on project needs
- Project management trends include agile, DevOps, mobile technologies, and virtual team management

**Project Manager Roles:**

- Project managers serve as Planners, Organizers, Coaches, Problem Solvers, and Communicators
- Essential skills include budgeting, resource management, emotional intelligence, and conflict resolution
- Common mistakes include poor stakeholder management and unclear responsibility assignment

**Product Backlog Management:**

- User stories follow "As a [role], I want [action], so that [benefit]" format
- INVEST criteria ensures stories are Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable
- Spikes (research tasks) help resolve uncertainty in requirements or implementation approaches
- User stories evolve through discovery, planning, execution, and acceptance testing

## Estimation

Effective software estimation is essential for project success, yet uniquely challenging due to factors like productivity variability, requirement volatility, and rapid innovation. Below is a summary of key concepts and practices:

**1. Estimation Challenges:**

- Software estimation is less predictable than in other industries due to invisible progress, changing requirements, and wide productivity differences.
- Aim for accuracy (closeness to true value) over false precision; use ranges and review estimation history to improve.

**2. Estimation Phases:**

- **Size Estimation:** How much and how complex? (e.g., user stories, function points, lines of code)
- **Effort Estimation:** How long and how many people? (person-hours, team composition)
- **Cost Estimation:** What is the budget? (labor, infrastructure, operational, contingency)
- These are interdependent—changing one affects the others.

**3. Metrics in Estimation:**

- **Product Metrics:** Size (LOC, functions), complexity, quality
- **Process Metrics:** Time, effort, efficiency, stability
- **Resource Metrics:** Team size, productivity, cost
- **Size-based metrics:** Tangible counts (LOC, modules)
- **Function-based metrics:** Function points, object points, use case points, story points (focus on delivered value)

**4. Estimation Techniques:**

- **Expert Judgment:** Leverages experience; quick but subjective
- **Delphi Method:** Structured, anonymous expert consensus
- **Historical/Analogous:** Based on similar past projects
- **Parametric/Algorithmic:** Uses mathematical models (e.g., COCOMO)
- **Decomposition:** Breaks project into smaller, estimable units
- **Phased Estimation:** Detailed for near-term, rough for future phases
- **Pricing to Win:** Scope adjusted to fit a fixed budget

**5. Agile Estimation Approaches:**

- **Story Points:** Relative complexity, estimated by team consensus
- **Planning Poker:** Consensus-based estimation using cards (often Fibonacci sequence)
- **MoSCoW Prioritization:** Must, Should, Could, Won't have
- **Velocity & Burndown Charts:** Track progress and forecast delivery

**6. Cost Estimation and Pricing:**

- **Cost Models:** Top-down (broad, early), bottom-up (detailed, later), or hybrid
- **Pricing Models:** Cost-plus, opportunity, going rate, monopolistic, loss leader, etc.
- **Per-person-hour cost:** Includes direct labor and overhead (indirect staff, facilities, utilities)
- **Employee cost analysis:** Considers gross salary, taxes, and additional contributions

**7. Practical Example:**

- Estimation connects user stories to release planning, timeline projections, and cost calculation (see online bookshop example in the full document).

**Key Takeaway:**

- Use a combination of metrics and techniques, adapt to project context, and continuously refine estimates based on feedback and historical data.

## Planning

Planning encompasses defining project scope, creating work breakdown structures, scheduling activities, and allocating resources. It involves both predictive approaches (traditional/waterfall) and adaptive methodologies (agile) depending on the clarity of requirements and project environment.

## Risk management

Risk management focuses on identifying potential risks, analyzing their impact, and developing mitigation strategies. This ongoing process includes risk identification, assessment, response planning, and continuous monitoring throughout the project lifecycle.

## Software quality

Software quality management ensures that project deliverables meet defined standards and user requirements. It involves quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control processes that maintain the integrity of software products.

## Standards

Modern project management relies on established standards and methodologies to ensure consistency, quality, and successful outcomes. Below is a summary of key standards and when to use each:

**1. Métrica 3**

- **Purpose:** Methodology for planning, developing, and maintaining information systems, especially in Spain's public sector.
- **When to use:** Public IT projects in Spain or where legal/traceability requirements are strict.
- **Key features:** Phase-based, strong documentation, quality gates, based on ISO/IEC standards.

**2. PRINCE2**

- **Purpose:** Structured project management method emphasizing control, roles, and stage boundaries.
- **When to use:** Projects needing formal control, documentation, and clear governance (e.g., government, large organizations).
- **Key features:** Business case focus, stage reviews, adaptable to traditional and agile projects.

**3. Scrum**

- **Purpose:** Agile framework for iterative, incremental product development.
- **When to use:** Fast-changing environments, startups, or feature-driven teams needing adaptability.
- **Key features:** Sprints, roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team), artifacts (backlogs, burndown charts), regular reviews.

**4. Extreme Programming (XP)**

- **Purpose:** Agile methodology focused on engineering practices for high-quality code.
- **When to use:** Teams prioritizing technical excellence, rapid feedback, and frequent releases.
- **Key features:** Test-driven development, pair programming, continuous integration.

**5. Lean Software Development**

- **Purpose:** Minimize waste and maximize value in software delivery.
- **When to use:** Projects seeking efficiency, rapid delivery, and continuous improvement.
- **Key features:** Eliminate waste, empower teams, deliver fast, build quality in.

**6. Kanban**

- **Purpose:** Visual workflow management to optimize flow and limit work in progress.
- **When to use:** Maintenance, support, DevOps, or teams seeking incremental process improvement.
- **Key features:** Visual boards, WIP limits, evolutionary change.

**7. PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)**

- **Purpose:** Comprehensive framework covering all aspects of project management.
- **When to use:** Large, complex projects or portfolios needing structured processes and best practices.
- **Key features:** Process groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing), 10 knowledge areas (scope, time, cost, quality, etc.), RACI matrices.

**Choosing a Methodology:**

- Consider project size, complexity, regulatory needs, and stakeholder involvement.
- Métrica 3: Public sector IT in Spain.
- Scrum/XP: Fast-paced, product-focused teams.
- PRINCE2: Projects needing control and documentation.
- Lean/Kanban: Continuous delivery, maintenance, or process improvement.
- PMBOK: Comprehensive oversight for large or complex initiatives.
- Tailor your approach—combine elements as needed for your project's context.
